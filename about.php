    <li>Blood bank is a place where blood bag that is collected from blood donation events is stored in one place. The term “blood bank” refers to a division of a hospital laboratory where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed to reduce the risk of transfusion related events . The process of managing the blood bag that is received from the blood donation events needs a proper and systematic management.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 24rem;">The blood bag must be handled with care and treated thoroughly as it is related to someone’s life. The development of Web-based Blood Bank And Donation Management System (BBDMS) is proposed to provide a management functional to the blood bank in order to handle the blood bag and to make entries of the individuals who want to donate blood and who are in need.</li>
